# RFC 11: Revisions Admin API (superseded by [RFC 15](015-revisions-api-revised.md))

* RFC: 11
* Author: Karl Hobley
* Created: 2016-07-18
* Last Modified: 2016-07-31

## Abstract

Currently, the Admin API can only access the live version of a page's content.
In order to support page editing, we must allow the admin API to access the
latest draft and also create new revisions and publish them.

I also think that the revisions UI currently in Wagtail would be better
implemented using the admin API as this would allow us to implement it in a
way that doesn't require the user to navigate away from the editor.

This RFC proposes an extension to the Admin API to allow page revisions to be
retrieved and created.

## Specification

### Data format

All of the responses return revisions in the following format

```json

    {
        "id": 1,
        "created_at": "2016-07-18T16:37:00+01:00",
        "author": "karl",
        "in_moderation": false,
        "content": {
            "title": "Home",
            "body": "foo"
        }
   }
```

### URL structure

We will add a new endpoint underneath the pages endpoint allowing access to
revisions of specific pages.

#### View all revisions of a page

This will be paginated to show up to 20 revisions at a time.

    GET /api/pages/revisions/?page_id=1

The list will be formatted the same way as other listings in the API:

```json

    {
        "meta": {
            "total_count": 50,
        },
        "items": [
            # Revisions here
        ]
    }
```

##### Filter by date/time range

Date or date/time in ISO8601 format. If a date is specified, both ends of the
range are inclusive (equivalent to Django's __gte and __lte queries)

The start and end times are separated by three dots: '...'. One end of the
range may be omitted making that end unbounded.

    GET /api/pages/revisions/?page_id=1&created_at=2016-07-18...
    GET /api/pages/revisions/?page_id=1&created_at=...2016-07-18
    GET /api/pages/revisions/?page_id=1&created_at=2016-01-01...2016-07-18
    GET /api/pages/revisions/?page_id=1&created_at=2016-07-18T16:37:00+01:00...

##### Filter by author

Filters by the value of the ``USERNAME_FIELD`` on the user model

    GET /api/pages/revisions/?page_id=1&author=karl

#### View a particular revision

##### By ID

    GET /api/pages/revisions/123/

##### By earliest/latest created at date

Like the rest of the API, the revisions API also supports sorting/limiting
which allows fetching the latest/earliest revisions.

    GET /api/pages/revisions/?page_id=1&order=-created_at&limit=1  (latest)
    GET /api/pages/revisions/?page_id=1&order=created_at&limit=1   (earliest)


#### Create a new revision (edit a page)

Creating a new revision is done by submitting the value of the "content" field
as a JSON dictionary to the following URL

    POST /api/pages/revisions/?page_id=1

##### Submit for moderation

Saves and submits the new revision for moderation

    POST /api/pages/revisions/?submit_for_moderation=true

##### Publish

Saves and publishes the new revision

    POST /api/pages/revisions/?page_id=1&publish=true

##### Safeguarding against double-edit

Double editing can be implemented by sending the previous revision id to the
server on save. If there is a more recent revision that has already been
committed to the server, the revision being submitted would be rejected.

    POST /api/pages/revisions/?page_id=1&if_current_revision_id=1

Note that this doesn't mean that the user is told they must refresh the page
and lose their changes. It may even be possible to resolve conflicts manually
by retrieving the latest revision and merging the two. This process is out of
scope for this RFC though.

##### Locked pages

A page cannot be edited in any way if it is locked, so attempting to create a
new revision for a locked page will result in a ``423 Locked`` response code
and the new revision will not be saved.
